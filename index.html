            <h2>Noelle is a playable Geo character in Genshin Impact.</h2>
            <p>Extremely strong and reliable, Noelle is considered to be "the maid of all maids" in the Knights of Favonius, with many thinking she has the ability to be everywhere all at once. She is stubborn, however, and willing to unnecessarily endanger her life at any moment to help someone. She has tried many times to join the ranks of the Knights of Favonius to accomplish her dream of becoming a full-fledged knight, but has fallen short every time so far.</p>

            <h2>How to Use Noelle</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Shield and Heal Up</h3>
                <img src="img/noelle-full-body.png" alt="noelle full body">
                <p>Noelle's Elemental Skill, Breastplate, creates a shield that scales with her Defense and gives her Normal Attacks a chance to heal the party. The healing from Breastplate also scales with her Defense. The more tanky Noelle is, the better support she can provide!
                <br>
                Noelle's shield will auto trigger if she is not on the battlefield and the active character drops below 30%. This is a great emergency defense mechanism that could save your main DPS from certain doom!</p>

                <h3>Stack DEF Artifacts</h3>
                <img src="img/noelle-aether.png" alt="noelle with aether">
                <p>Despite being a defense-based character, Noelle has the potential to deal heavy damage!
                <br>
                Noelle's Elemental Burst, Sweeping Time, converts all Normal Attacks into Geo AoE attacks and boosts her Attack stat based on her Defense. Keeping her Defense stats as high as possible will yield the best results for her damage and the team's survival.</p>

                <h3>Dash to Extend Combos</h3>
                <img src="img/noelle-half-body.png" alt="noelle half body">
                <p>The 4th hit of Noelle's Normal Attack combo will launch enemies out of Noelle's attack range and also has a long recovery animation. Dashing after the 4th hit will not only cancel the recovery animation but will also keep your target in-range, extending your combo.</p>
